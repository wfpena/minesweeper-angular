## About the project

### **Design and Technologies:**

* `SASS` for styling.
* ``Karma`` and ``Jasmine`` used for the **unit tests** implementation and **code coverage reports**
* ``Webpack`` is used for the build. Using [@angular-builders/custom-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-builders/custom-webpack) to overwrite the Angular build defaults.

> There are two options for webpack config. `webpack.dev.config.ts` (Development)  and `webpack.config.ts` (Production).
* ``ESLint`` is used as linter
* ``Yarn`` is used as default package manager

<br/>

### **Features:**

* Regular Minesweeper gameplay. Adding flags, timer, bomb count, etc.

* Multiplayer support. Currently hardcoded for a max o 4 players but its easily changeable on the code.

* Save / Loading of previous games

* Difficulty levels (easy, medium and hard). With the addition of `custom` level for the player to choose the size of the board and amount of bombs.

## Coverage Report

1. Run `yarn test:report`
2. The results will be shown on the console and the report will be generated on `./coverage/minesweeper-angular/`. <i>You can open the `index.html` file on that folder to see the results</i>

## Build

* **Production Build**:

Run `yarn build` to make the production build. The output path will be on the folder `dist\minesweeper-angular`.
> NOTE: The build setup can be overwritten using webpack by modifying the `webpack.config.ts` file.

* **Development Build**

You can run `yarn watch` to make a development build and watch for code changes.

You can also run `yarn build:dev` to make the development build.

> NOTE: To customize the dev build you can modify the `webpack.dev.config.ts` file.

## Linter

Run `yarn lint` to run the linter.

TODOS:

* Improve styling, the styles are very convuluted currently.
* Improve multiplayer support to add possibility of adding the names of the players.
